Alert Logic Automated Azure Deployment Script

This script, when integrated into existing automation tools like Terraform, Puppet, etc, will create deployment tiles for each Azure subscription input. 
This allows end users to programatically scale Alert Logic resources alongside an Azure Cloud Environment. 
It should be noted that this script does NOT create or deploy IDS or Scanner appliances, nor does it install Alert Logic agents on VM's. 
In fact, this script will not deploy anything into any Azure environment, ever. It only deploys Alert Logic resources on Alert Logic infrastructure. 
If you need to automate the creation of Cloud infrastructure, use the appropriate dev-ops tools for that purpose.'"
